PROJECT UPDATE NOTES: EPISODE 09 EXTENDED
=================================

== Level Manager ==

_ Independently created LevelManager script and LoadNextLevel + ReloadCurrentLevel
_ Added ref >> public LevelManager _levelManager; << to GameManager and >> _levelManager.ReloadCurrentLevel(); <<>> _levelManager.LoadNextLevel(); << 
_ Created temp scenes and added to Build Settings 
_ Tested loading scenes and it worked!
_ BUT it's hard to manage various aspects of UI etc across multiple levels so I want to introduce a proper Scene Manager
_ Found this Tarodev tutorial so will attempt to insert into this project AFTER E10

== MENU ==
_ Created Credits screen + Quit button
_ Created Start menu + button
_ Added Credits & MenuManager scripts but these could probably be integrated with our LevelManager (which Brackeys did not have)
