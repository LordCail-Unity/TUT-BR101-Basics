PROJECT UPDATE NOTES: EPISODE 09
=================================


== Finish Line ==
Parented components into a single empty GameObject.

USED METHOD FROM THE COMMENTS NOT BRACKEYS METHOD..

@skarian 
> For those  having trouble with the EndTrigger, here's a somewhat quick solution: 

1_Delete the EndTrigger script.
2_Add a new tag called "EndTrigger" and apply it onto the End block.
3_Add a new if statement inside PlayerCollision and check for the tag "EndTrigger". If found, add the following line inside:  FindObjectOfType<GameManager>().CompleteLevel();
4_Make sure the BoxCollider component inside the End block is active and that the isTrigger toggle inside the component has been turned off.

@LordCail_Unity
> 3 years on and using Unity2020.3LTS I followed your method successfully!

1) Removed EndTrigger completely. 
2) Copied an obstacle block, transformed and resized at the finish line, disabled mesh render and added tag "FinishLine".
3) Copied the RestartLevel method in PlayerCollision.cs and adapted to LevelComplete method in GameManager..
4) In GameManager.LevelComplete method used IEnumerator to wait for Delay seconds, display UI, then wait for Any Key and call Next Level.. Applied same logic to LevelRestart method and used a LevelRestartUI panel to get rid of Invoke (which relies on a static script and is dangerous for Refactoring / Debugging)


== Menu Animation ==

_ Ignored calling Script in Animation part of tutorial
_ Applied animation tutorial to LevelCompleteUI and LevelRestartUI 
_ Created two animation components: one NOT looped (LevelCompleteUIAnim), one LOOPED (LevelCompleteUIAnimBlink)
_ Set "Press any key" to 0 alpha so it is transparent; Blink loop controls only the any key object looping from 0 alpha (0 secs) to 255a (1s) AND back to 0a (2s)
_ Messed around for an hour trying to figure out why it wasn't working before I realized I was editing the LevelCOMPLETEUI anims but testing the LevelRESTARTUI
_ In Animator click the transition arrow: Exit Time: 1, Set Transition Duration:0 | Offset:0 | Untick Fixed Duration

PROJECT UPDATE NOTES: EPISODE 09 EXTENDED
=================================


== Level Manager ==

_ Independently created LevelManager script and LoadNextLevel + ReloadCurrentLevel
_ Added ref >> public LevelManager _levelManager; << to GameManager and >> _levelManager.ReloadCurrentLevel(); <<>> _levelManager.LoadNextLevel(); << 
_ Created temp scenes and added to Build Settings 
_ Tested loading scenes and it worked!
_ BUT it's hard to manage various aspects of UI etc across multiple levels so I want to introduce a proper Scene Manager
_ Found this Tarodev tutorial so will attempt to insert into this project AFTER E10
