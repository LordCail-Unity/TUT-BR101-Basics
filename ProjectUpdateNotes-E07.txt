=================================
PROJECT UPDATE NOTES: EPISODE 07
=================================

== Rendering ==
Switched project to Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
-- Package Manager > Unity Registry > Universal RP > Install
-- Create RenderMats folder then Create > Rendering > URP > Pipeline Asset (Forward)
-- Update ALL Materials > Shader: URP / Lit & update Base Map: Color 
-- Edit > Project Settings > 

== Fog Disabled ==
URP mode broke my default fog! Makes Ground disappear during play mode as you move further into the level.
Searched for a solution but couldn't find one quickly so moving on with quick fix.
Changing fog to Linear mode fixes disappearing ground but then there is no fog. 
Exponential Mode: 0.01 is one possible compromise.
Disabling fog entirely looks better imho.

== Movement & Collision ==
Edit > Project Settings > Time > Fixed Timestep: 0.01
Changed for Player & Obstacles:
RigidBody > Collision Detection > Continuous
Adjust Player > ForwardForce: 4000

== Environment ==
Tweaked obstacles for new movement

== UI ==
Tutorial uses outdated Text system.
Use new TextMeshPro system instead.

		}
	}
