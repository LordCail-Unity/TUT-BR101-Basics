Note: @8:00 Bardent's GitHub tutorial refers to Project Settings > Editor > Mode: Visible Meta Files
In Unity2020.3LTS, this setting has moved to Project Settings > Version Control > Mode: Visible Meta Files
Project Settings > Editor > Asset Serialization > Mode: Force Text is still correct
Both are default settings in 2020.3LTS.
