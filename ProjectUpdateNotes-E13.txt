Basic setup integrated into Brackeys project as separate scenes.

Realised that to integrate tutorials cleanly and understand what we've changed the best way is to do the tutorial exactly as-is but add comments as you go for things that need to be changed. 

Then relabel the tutorial scripts to include a prefix/suffix eg PlayerController > PlayerControllerBMO

Next, create a copy that can then be integrated back in with the main project, which helps to understand what has changed and how to manage it.
