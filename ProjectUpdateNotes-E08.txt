PROJECT UPDATE NOTES: EPISODE 08
=================================


== Build Settings ==
File > Build Settings
> Assigned L00 & L01

== GameManager ==
Created new Empty GameManager object & script
Need to reference GameManager in EndGame however hard coding into Player object is a bad idea so we will use FindObjectOfType.

== Player ==
Separate PlayerMesh from Player.
Player object can now be centered at (0,0,0) whereas the cube pivot sits at 0.5.
This poses issue with movement as the original cube's RigidBody is propelled but the Parent object is not.
Quick Fix based on: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71980013/proper-gameobject-structure-and-how-to-move-the-parent-object-when-the-child-is
Move RigidBody AND Collider to the Parent object.

Updated below by dragging Player object into relevant slots..
> Main Camera > CameraMovement script > Player: Player (new object)
> ScoreText > Player: Player (new object)

== Restart Level ==
Used restartLevel Instead of EndGame as this is more accurate.
Could also be called by a Restart button as well as automatically called when crashing etc.
